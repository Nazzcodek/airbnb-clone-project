# Team Roles
### Business analyst (BA)
- A business analyst dives deep into a customer’s workflows and analyzes stakeholder feedback to help a client formulate what their wants look like and align a customer’s vision with what a development team is producing.
- They translate an abstract product idea into a set of tangible requirements.
### Product owner (PO)
- Holding more responsibility for a product’s success than any other development team member, a product owner is a decision-maker. Balancing both business needs and market trends, they define a business strategy, shape up the product vision, make sure it satisfies customer needs, and manage a product backlog. Associated mainly with flexible Agile environments, a product owner is particularly useful in scenarios where requirements and workflows frequently change.
### Project manager (PM)
- In sequential models, a project manager is responsible for distributing tasks across team members, planning work activities, and updating project status.
- In Agile projects where the focus is on self-management, transparency, and shared ownership, a PM sets up the vision of a product, maintains transparency, fosters communication, searches for improvements in the development process, and makes sure a team delivers more value with each iteration.
### UI/UX designer
- There are two aspects to the product design process—user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design.
- A UI designer devises intuitive, easy-to-use, and eye-pleasing interfaces for a product, while the UX part stands for thinking out an entire journey of a user’s interaction with a product. A UX designer is thus involved in such activities as user research, persona development, information architecture design, wireframing, prototyping, and more.
### Software developer
- Engineers and stabilizes the product
- Solves any technical problems emerging during the development lifecycle
- A software developer does the actual job and codes an application. And just like an app features a front end and a back end, there are front-end and back-end developers.
- Front-end developers create the part of an application that users interact with, ensuring that an app offers an equally smooth experience to all—no matter the device, platform, or operational system.
### Quality assurance (QA) engineer
- Makes sure an application performs according to requirements
- Spots functional and non-functional defects
- The job of a quality assurance engineer is to verify whether an application meets the requirements—both functional and non-functional. Functional requirements define what an application should do, while non-functional requirements specify how it should do that. To verify both, QA specialists run various checks, followed by analyzing the test results and reporting on the application quality.
### DevOps engineer
- Facilitates cooperation between development and operations teams
- Builds continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines for faster delivery
- Even in Agile environments, development and operations teams can be siloed. DevOps engineers serve as a link between the two teams, unifying and automating the software delivery process and helping strike a balance between introducing changes quickly and keeping an application stable. Working together with software developers, system administrators, and operational staff, DevOps engineers oversee and facilitate code releases on a CI/CD basis.
